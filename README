Neon Tower Defense

Python 3 and Pygame based Tower defense game.
Currently all graphics are generated by code.
Run "main.py" to get the game going.

TODO:
Add towers
Add functionality of grabbing towers (can't grab without money) (can't grab if holding tower)
Add functionality of placing towers
add see-through tower to the cell you are hovering over
add tower range showing up relative to the cell you are hovering over (for all towers unless you are holding a tower)
Add enemy spawning
Test
Add a pause button
Move buttons to consistant spot in window

Maybe:
Menu - make everything relative to the object above it. (that would make moving stuff around easier)

Import this into PyCharm to use the venv folder etc. Otherwise just get all the python files.
